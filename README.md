# Docker-env

Doceker Image in DockerHub [(Link)](https://hub.docker.com/r/cis548/docker-env)

Note: This project is in **alpha** stage, meaning that it is usable, but will be going through constant updates.

## Push to DockerHub

- `docker build -t cis548/docker-env .`
- `docker push cis548/docker-env`

## Usage

### Preparations

1. Install Docker Desktop (version 3.0+). For Windows, we recommend setting up WSL2.
1. Copy `docker-compose.yml` to your course projects folder.

### First-time Setup

1. Run `docker pull cis548/docker-env` to will pull the docker image from Docker Hub repository.
1. Run `docker-compose run --rm mcit` to launch a Docker Container. 
  - `--rm` will clean up the container when it is finished.
  - The home directory `/home/cit595`, also known as `~`, is synchornized with the folder, where you put the `docker-compose.yml`, in your Host System.

You should now be inside your docker image, with current folder at `/homw/cit595`. You can use `pwd` to check.

You will log into the container as user `cit595` with password `mcit`. The password is used just in case you occationally need sudo previlege.

### All Future Log-ins

Just open your course projects folder, and run `docker-compose run mcit bash`.

### Multiple Sessions

To establish multiple sesssion to the same
 container, call `docker exec -it [container_id] bash` after booting the first window with `docker-compose run mcit bash`.

### About `docker-compose`

The following is the offical definition of docker-compose:

> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

In CIT 595, we only use `docker-compose` to start one service which is your virtual machine. But `docker-compose` make the command consice and convient because we can predefine the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

If we use the bare-mental `docker` to have the samilar virtual machine, you have to run 

```
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/home/cit595 cis548/docker-env
```
This is why we choose to use `docker-compose`, but the overhead is you have to prepare a `docker-compose.yml` file.
